## Overview

This is a basic Contact Us Form Page built with the React library. Users can enter their details, and the form includes validation for the input fields.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1. Created the HTML skeleton.
2. Used the Bootstrap library to enhance the page's appearance.
3. Using mobile first and responsive approach.
4. Created state values.
5. Adding onClick and onChnage events.
6. Updated state values on each rerender.
7. Adding validation for required field.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

For me personally, I already knew majority of the concepts, but as I was out of practice, this was my way of revising it.

### Useful resources

- [Github Pages](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally publish the site. I'd recommend it to anyone having difficulty publishing their react projects on github.
